# PHP on Petals 🌸

A wedding website
(handle carefully so that it doesn't break apart)

* 🌿 organic - grown organically without a plan or design.
* 🍐 raw - no build process, you run it as it is.
* 🔐 trusted - you have to simply trust it, there is no test suite.
* ✅ tested - on our small wedding.
* 🔰 straightforward - there are no obfuscatory layers between the content you want to write and the web browser - so go ahead and learn some HTML.
* 🇨🇿 better lorem ipsum - professional templates use lorem ipsum as a text placeholder. That is so meaningless and inscrutable. This web uses an actual language instead of lorem ipsum. It's inscrutable for most of humanity anyway.
* 📃Simple setup process - you just open the php file in your favorite text editor and start reading from the beginning. It's only 2339 lines!
* 📋TODO-driven setup process - you ctrl-f for "TODO" and it tells you what to do.
* 👚Custom-tailored - since you have to write your own text labels and buttons and all text, you can be original and use the kind of language your friends know you to use.
* ♲̶ No templates - what are templates? Inherently safe from template injection attacks.
* 🎪Low-maintenance - something like PHP 5 is enough.
* ⏳No database - the filesystem is our database and it serves the purpose well. Backups and content editing has never been easier! Just fire up your favorite FTP client and you are good to go. (Concurrent access is taken care of and works correctly, that's why booking an item takes about 3 seconds.)
